<h1>AWS Building Virual Private Cloud Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I used Amazon VPC in my project by creating a screened subnet with auto
assigned IPV4 addresses for new machines joining the newly launched VPC
and assigning it to an internet gateway to allow for public internet access.
The documentation and all my notes can be found in the PDF above!
